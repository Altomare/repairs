Hi,

    I connected up the on-line Horizon's second serial port to the terminal
server, so you can upload/download files to it via Kermit.

    First, connect to the console port with telnet, ie:
telnet://www.cpm80.com:2003

    Next, connect to the second serial port with C-Kermit under Linux, or
Kermit-95 under Windows.  Connect to the following address:
www.cpm80.com:2004

    Put C-Kermit or Kermit-95 into "Server" mode.

    Run Kermit-80 on the Northstar: A> KERMIT

    Now, you can do things like: remote dir
    remote cd <directory>
    get <filename>
    send <filename>

    I made a new CP/M Hard Disk Unit on Drive C: for people to upload
programs to.  This way you can try out your favorite CP/M software if it's
not already on the machine.

    Note that the text output in Kermit-95 didn't seem right to me.  The
screen output from the Horizon looked much better in telnet under Linux, and
Telnet under Windows XP.  I think there is something not set right with the
newline translation under Kermit-95.  This is noticeable if you use
Kermit-95 to connect to the console, or if you do a "remote dir" for example
from the CP/M machine to the kermit server.

    In addition, I added the two other serial ports from the Altos 5-15
running MP/M-II, so if you connect first to: telnet://www.cpm80.com:2005
(console port) and then to either or both telnet://www.cpm80.com:2006 or
telnet://www.cpm80.com:2007 you can run multiple users.  Note that no
programs (including DIR) are copied to the other user accounts, so perhaps
someone can take care of that for me. :)

    If you have any question, please feel free to ask...

    Howard
