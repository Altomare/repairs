While working for Phoenix Software Associates I ported MSDOS to
the Z80-based Otrona Attache 8:16 (Mike Aronson fit an 8086
into the printer option slot!).
Here's a copy of the floppies I had for mine.

------------------------------------------------------------------


These are copies of the diskettes that remained with
my original Otrona Attache. THe computer was sold on eBay, and the
buyer copied all the diskette contents to CD-ROM for me. THe dates
were lost (since CP/M did not keep them), but a few directories
contain files with dated names. Also some of the ADVENTURE files
are from 1980 (Eric's friend Keith, etc), which is odd since in
1980 in our rented house we had a PDOS machine (rack mount, what
waws the brand?) with 8" floppies. Must have been backed up
(likely).

.CPM == .COM CP/M-80 binary executables.

The BASIC files are mainly Otrona Attache, with many
non-standard graphics extentions. The MBASIC stuff is likely plain
old MBASIC.

Adventure is a Z80, TDL/Xitan FORTRAN-compiled version
of the "original" 350 point version. A map exists in my papers
somewhere.
