BPROMs were read as 2716 using the following adapter:

https://team-europe.blogspot.com/2022/06/bprom-read-adapter-v02-21in1.html

The dumps were then truncated to the right size using `truncate` on Linux.

Because U603 had a leng bent and soldered to another, I could not re-bend the leg as it would likely break.
I removed the solder between the two legs, put heatshrink to isolate the bent leg and then added a temporary leg salvaged from a dead resistor array.

Pictures of this setup are in `../pic`.

# Other dumps from online

Also present are dumps from:
* Bitsavers
* Don Maslin's archive
* Santo, from retrocomputer.ca
* Unknown source, Rev H from a MAME BIOS dump

The one from Don Maslin's are identical to Rev F on bitsavers.

Not included (yet) are the 8-16 card dumps.

Santo's boot ROM was on a 8KB ROM, but the second half is all zeros
The first half is identical to the MAME dump.
