BPROMs were read as 2716 using the following adapter:

The dumps were then truncated to the right size using `truncate` on Linux.

Because U603 had a leng bent and soldered to another, I could not re-bend the leg as it would likely break.
I removed the solder between the two legs, put heatshrink to isolate the bent leg and then added a temporary leg salvaged from a dead resistor array.

Pictures of this setup are in `../pic`.
